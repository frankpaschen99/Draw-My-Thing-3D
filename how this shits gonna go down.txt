Lobby System
	- Niggas gon be able to create private lobbies so they can play wit their homies, ya hear?
	- Aight so lobbies gon have passwords so they can be even more private
	- Each lobby is gonna have one of Alex's famous whiteboards, which will be cleared each round, and only
		one person will be able to draw on it at a time.
Chat System
	- OOOOOOHHHHH SHIT! We also gots to have chat! Ya hear? CHAT! CHAT SYSTEM!
	- Its okay tho cause nodejs is easy as fuck and its ok if our site is slow as BALLS
	- Niggas can chat to each other pre-game, but once a round starts, everything said in chat
		will be processed as a guess, and when someone types in the right word, they get POINTS!!!!!
Round System
	- Frankie gon code this shit now, ya feel?
	- Playas and homies alike gon take turns drawin on alex's whiteboard
	- folks in the chat have 60 seconds (1 MINUTE!!) to guess the drawin
	- when 60 secs is up, the word is revealed if not everyone has guessed it already
Main Server
	- yoooo, how we gon do shit without a server?? wit nodejs we gon have a master server that will handle
		the systems listed above
